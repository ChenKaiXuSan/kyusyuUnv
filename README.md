This repository is the selection process of Kyushu University.  
I put the two types of tasks in two folders respectively.
They named basic tasks folder, and advanced tasks folder.

I put the code and results of each task in a separate folder, named by the [task number_descritpion].
In each task folder, I wrote a readme.md file, as a report.
In order to avoid the problem of markdown math formulas displaying garbled characters, I generated a pdf file and placed it in the same folder.

The task i finished is bellow:
